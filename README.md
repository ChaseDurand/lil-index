# lil-index
Lil Index is a script that examines correlations (or perhaps causations?) between album release dates and the S&P 500. It uses the Spotify API via [spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy) to retrieve albums and their associated release dates from a given artist, then examines historical $SPX data to judge whether that artist releases' indicate a short period bull or bear market.
